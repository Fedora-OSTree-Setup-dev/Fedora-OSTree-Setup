## Set up Arkenfox for a secure Firefox browser

[Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) is a hardened Firefox settings set, setting many critical Firefox switches, removing tracking and making you more secure.

It makes your Browser as hardened as the Tor Browser, just without the onion routing.

With a few settings (optional of course) you can make it work really well.

[I made a script to do this automatically, here you can get it.](https://github.com/trytomakeyouprivate/Arkenfox-softening)

Use either the Flatpak or native commands, depending on what package of Firefox you use.
