# Installation

**The project is currently in active development**

The project is written in Python >= 3.11, and does not need to be
compiled however, the dependencies are needed to be installed in a
`$PATH` accessible by python.

The authors recommend to install the project dependencies inside
virtualbox and test the project inside:

```
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

Then activate the virtual environment, and install the dependencies
with:

```
python3.11 -m pip install -r REQUIREMENTS
```

And run the main module:

```
python -m src.main
```
